This will be expanded a lot later on... but for now it is what it is.\r\n\r\nTo use it `npm install -g generator-monumentjs-cli` and then `yo monumentjs-cli` and you are on the road.\r\n\r\n##Documentation\r\n\r\n###Main Generator\r\n\r\nTo use it: `yo monumentjs-cli`\r\n\r\nThis will lay down a base project that looks like this:\r\n```\r\napp.js\r\npackage.json\r\nroutes.json\r\nroutes\r\n    home.js\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe routes.json file contains a base route for the `/` get request that is matched by the `home.js` route handler. You can take a look at it to see how you can put together your routes as you develop the application. It also installs the dependencies in the `package.json` file. (monumentjs and its dependencies dot.js and mime).\r\n\r\n###Sub-generators\r\n\r\nComing soon...","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
